# AI-Powered Web Application for Wireless and Mobile Network Design

**Repository:** AI-Powered-Web-Application-for-Wireless-and-Mobile-Network-Design

> A concise README for the project. This file summarizes the purpose, structure, requirements, and basic usage steps for running the project locally.

## About

This repository implements an AI-powered web application to assist in the design, simulation, and analysis of wireless and mobile networks. It contains a backend (Python) and frontend components. The backend likely includes the core models and APIs; the frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the system.

> Note: This README was generated from the repository layout (folders: `Backend`, `Frontend`, `venv`, files: `requirements.txt`, `render.yaml`). Adjust the commands and details below to match any project-specific scripts in the repository.

## Features

* Web UI for network design tasks.
* AI models for performance estimation, optimization, or recommendation.
* Backend APIs to run simulations and return results.
* Requirements captured in `requirements.txt`.

---

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+ (or compatible with the repository's virtual environment)
* Node.js & npm/yarn (if the frontend uses a typical JS framework)
* git

---

## Quick setup (local)

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GhassanQandeel/AI-Powered-Web-Application-for-Wireless-and-Mobile-Network-Design.git
cd AI-Powered-Web-Application-for-Wireless-and-Mobile-Network-Design
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Backend: (example) run the backend server. Replace with actual commands if different:

```bash
cd Backend
# If there's a Flask app:
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
# or
python app.py
```

5. Frontend: (example) run the frontend dev server. Replace depending on framework (React/Vue/Angular):

```bash
cd ../Frontend
npm install
npm start
```

6. Open the frontend in your browser (typically [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)).

## Project Structure (expected)

```
AI-Powered-Web-Application-for-Wireless-and-Mobile-Network-Design/
├── Backend/          # Python backend (APIs, models, simulation code)
├── Frontend/         # Web UI source code
├── venv/             # Optional: virtual environment files (usually excluded)
├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
├── render.yaml       # Render/hosting config (optional)
└── README.md         # This file
```

## Usage

Describe typical workflows here once you confirm exact run scripts. Example tasks:

* Start backend server
* Load the web UI
* Create a new network design (add base stations, clients)
* Run the simulation or model prediction
* View/download results (charts, reports)

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Add my feature"`
4. Push: `git push origin feature/my-feature`
5. Open a pull request

Please include tests and update this README with any new setup instructions.

---

## Troubleshooting

* If a dependency installation fails, try upgrading pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`.
* Check `requirements.txt` for pinned package versions.
* If the frontend fails to start, confirm Node.js version and package manager logs.
